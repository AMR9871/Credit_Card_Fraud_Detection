#  Credit Card Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression

Description:
This project focuses on implementing a credit card fraud detection system using logistic regression, leveraging the Scikit-Learn library, to address the challenges posed by an imbalanced dataset. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, serves as the foundation for our analysis and model development.

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Imbalanced Dataset Handling:** We tackle the inherent class imbalance problem in credit card fraud detection by employing logistic regression on both the original imbalanced dataset and a balanced dataset.

2. **Scikit-Learn Implementation:** We utilize Scikit-Learn's logistic regression algorithm, a powerful machine learning tool, to build and evaluate predictive models.

3. **Model Comparison:** This project provides a detailed comparison of the performance of logistic regression on the imbalanced and balanced datasets, offering insights into the significance of data preprocessing in fraud detection.

By exploring this repository, you can gain valuable insights into building a credit card fraud detection system using logistic regression and learn how to address the challenges presented by imbalanced data. The accompanying dataset from Kaggle, along with comprehensive code and documentation, allows you to reproduce and extend the results for your own analyses and applications.
